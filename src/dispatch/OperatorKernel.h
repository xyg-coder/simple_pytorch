 * Inherit from OperatorKernel to implement a c10 kernel.

 * Example:
 * > namespace {

 * >   public:
 * >     Tensor operator()(Tensor a, Tensor b) {...}
 * >   };

 *
 * The kernel class is allowed to have members but these are equivalent
 * to global variables. The kernel implementation is responsible for
 * preventing race conditions on them.
